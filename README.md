# Advanced-Rule-Validator

This repository hosts the Advanced Rule Validator, a robust tool designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of financial reporting through sophisticated rule-based data validation. The Rule Validator is tailored to process complex SQL rules on large datasets, leveraging Apache Spark and Hive to ensure scalability and performance.

Key features include:

Rule Parsing and Validation: Utilizes ANTLR for precise parsing and validation of user-defined SQL rules, ensuring adherence to syntax and semantics.

Dynamic Data Processing: Capable of handling diverse datasets and executing complex SQL queries to validate data against specified rules.

Enhanced Error Handling: Provides detailed error reports to help users identify and rectify issues in SQL rule definitions quickly.

Data Security and Privacy:
To uphold the highest standards of data security and privacy, all datasets used within this project have been thoroughly anonymized. Sensitive information has been removed or altered to prevent identification, ensuring that the data can be safely used for testing and development purposes without compromising privacy.
